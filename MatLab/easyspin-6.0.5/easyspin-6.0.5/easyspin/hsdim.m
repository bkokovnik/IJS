% hsdim  Dimension on spin state space
%
%   nStates = hsdim(SpinSystem)
%
%   Returns the Hilbert space dimension of spin system 'SpinSystem', which can
%   be either a spin system structure or a vector containing spin quantum
%   numbers.
%
%   All electron spins, nuclear spins (including classes of equivalent ones),
%   and orbital angular momenta are included in the calculation.

eprFit.fig: added 'Normalize All to Chi2' to menu under Edit tab
eprFit.m: lines 3309-3364: added mnuNormAllChi2_Callback function which asks for range and desired functions and normalizes 
	all specters to have the same chi2 as currently selected specter. Uses linear function simfun_str = 'z(1)*x + z(2)' 
	with default values '0*x + 0'. Fits using fminsearch, just like Sim, to minimize Chi2 first. Then multiplies each 
	specter (i) by sqrt(chi2(idx)/chi2(i)) where idx is first of currently selected specters.

	if at least one is fixed all get fixed
eprFit.m: lines 559+ in butFitFunc_Callback: removed converting cell uicoefs to struct coef and saving
	uicoefs to epr.fit.coef instead. using cell data type instead of struct allows use of different data types inside it
	but requires following changes to other code

EPR_fit.m: lines 41-43: removed previous data reading and changed it to use just cell arrays

eprFit.m: lines 3309-3359: reworked mnuNormAllChi2_Callback function to use fit() like Fit instead of fminsearch like Sim for 
	quicker results. Still uses linear function, starts at 0*x+0 and scales to chi2 the same way at the end.

	a 'Run' button
eprFit.m: lines: 1480, 1490, 1503, 1512, 1523, 1529-1537 in butNRA_Callback, butFitting_Callback, butSimul_Callback,

EPR_load.m: line 101 commented, line 102 removed "/(10^7)" to get reasonable values

**** Matja≈æ 2024_01_16
eprFit.m: lines 1794, 1842, 4120, 5492 notation change in export and fit values from fixed point to exponential

**** Tilen 2024_02_21
EPR_load.m: line 102 commented - we do not need to scale with gain anymore, since the Bruker xepr software is set to do this now.
EPR_load.m: line 98 and 99 uncommented - this two line were in the code originally, before I started to mess with it. This ignores the gain differences and gives some reasonable intensity values.

**** Korl 2024_07_19
brukerload.m: Added logic to set temp to 295 if the file name contains "RT" and the Temperature field is not found in the .DSC file.
              Introduced error handling to ensure npnt is set, throwing an error if it is not found in the .DSC file.
              Properly initialized all relevant variables (temp, npnt, freq, powr, cent, swep, modb, modf, rcco, stim, nscn, RCAG, ctim) to avoid issues with uninitialized variables.
              Ensured safe assignments to the exp structure by checking if variables are not empty before assigning them.
              Resolved dimension mismatch errors by ensuring proper initialization and use of variables.
              Corrected the amplitude correction logic to ensure nscn is set to 1 if it is empty or zero.

**** Korl 2024_07_30
eprFit.m: Changed fitting function (line 3429) to a polynomial     fitfunstr = 'a8*x^8 + a7*x^7 + a6*x^6 + a5*x^5 + a4*x^4 + a3*x^3 + a2*x^2 + a1*x + y0';

**** Korl 2024_08_09
eprFit.m Partially Fixed/changed: mnuSubBL_Callback (line 2700-ish), now works for multiple datasets, automatically fits a linear function to the endpoins and subtracts it on selected data
                still has a problem, where the user cant undo this step !!!!!(return original data not working for subBL)!!!!!
         Fixed: mnuSubFit_Callback (line 2780-ish), now works for all preselected data
         Fixed: mnuRetData_Callback (line 3900-ish), now works for all selected data at once 
         Changed: (line 3390-ish) normalize to chi2 now asks for polynomialy degree and fits accordingly

**** Korl 2024_08_12
        eprLoad.m (line 86-ish) when importing .txt files now prompts the user to use the same choices for H, Y, X columns and automatically applies them (I may have broken some other feature with this one)

**** Korl 2024_08_13
        eprFit.m (line 846) added residual plot to simulation 

**** Korl 2024_08_15
        eprFit.m (line 421 and 590-ish) plot and fit buttons now work on old .efi files (added some if statements).  
        RPR_fit.m (lines 60 and 128-ish) added if statements, so that fit button works for older .efi files. (RUN function does not work yet.)
 
**** Korl 2024_08_21
        EPR_load.m line 182, now recognizes halfinteger temperatures, written in filename as 'XpYK', where X and Y are integers and p is comma
